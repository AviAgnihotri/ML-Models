Welcome to the ML Models Folder - a collection of various machine learning models for different use cases.

Here is a brief description of each model available in this folder:
1. CO2 Emission Predictor:
This project aims to predict the CO2 emission of a car based on its features such as engine size, fuel consumption, and transmission type. The project uses a regression model to make predictions and is built using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

2. Medical Cost Prediction:
This project aims to predict the medical costs of patients based on features like age, gender, BMI, and smoking habits. The project uses a regression model to make predictions and is built using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

3. Bird Species Prediction:
This project aims to predict the species of a bird based on its features like beak length, wingspan, and weight. The project uses a classification model to make predictions and is built using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

4. Finding Hot Zone of Terrorism:
This project aims to find the hot zones of terrorism by analyzing terrorist attacks around the world. The project uses clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN to group similar attacks together and identify hot zones. The project is built using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn
